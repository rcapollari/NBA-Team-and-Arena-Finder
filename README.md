# SI-507-Final-Project
To run the project locally, type python app.py in the terminal and go to localhost:5000.

You will also need to create an account at https://openrouteservice.org/ and obtain an API key which will be used for the URL to create the map with directions to each NBA arena. 

Upon running the app, it will take you to the home page below. There is a Plotly map that the user can hover over to see the locations of each NBA team. The user will need to select a team on the right side menu to move forward.

Once a team has been selected, the user will go through a short series of questions to determine which page they want to land on.

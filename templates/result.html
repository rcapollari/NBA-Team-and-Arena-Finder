<!-- If User select no, then navigate to the necessary page. We'll need a way to tell which leaf of the
    tree we are on so that we know which path to navigate to.

    Maybe an if-statement like if result == "" then go to this link else go to the other link

    Also keep in mind that we still need to keep track of which team we are referring to.
    Could be easier once we implement this into that specific route in questions.-->
